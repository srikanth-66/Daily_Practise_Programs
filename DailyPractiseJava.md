java history
JDK->JRE->JVM->JIT Compiler
string pool,heap,stack memory,class loader

variables
Data Types->Primitive and Non Primitive
Primitive Data types -> byte,short,char,int,long,double,float and boolean also called as pre-defined datatypes
Non-primitive Data types -> class,Array etc 
String Data types comes under user defined data type or Non primitive data type
class variable or instance variables
local variables
constructors
parameterised and non parametarised constructors
Method calling from main
toString
String Functions
Basic programs
Conditional Statements if,else if,Switch,neseted if
Itertive statements for,do while,while
enhanced for loop and for each loop
pattern printing
Command line Arguments
String buffer
StringBuilder
Recurssion Approach
Object Oriented Programming System conceps -> 
classes-       logical entity-blue print 
objects-       real time entities,which have state and behaviour n number of instance can be created to the class 
Abstraction -  Hiding the internal or un necessary data or functionality to the user call abstraction it can be acheived through abstract classes (partially) interfaces(fully) 
Encapsulation- Binding the data into a single unit called Encapsulation and can used main;y for security of data and can acheive through getters and setters
Polymorphism - one thing can perform many forms . we acheive through Method overloading/static polymorhism/early binding within in the same class amd overriding in derived classes 
Inheritance-   we can acheive through classes single,multi leval,Hiercheial and through interfaces Multiple and hybrid inheritance
